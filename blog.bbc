Here is where I'll put my thoughts as they relate to [[Senna]]. I might talk about changes that I have things to say about, or just thoughts on the state of the champion. Changes don't have to directly affect [[Senna]], just anything I think will affect her performance.

[h2]Patch 11.10 - 5/13/2021[/h2][indent]
[i][b][[Guinsoo's Rageblade]]'s Gold Cost 2800 -> 2600[/b][/i]

[[Senna]] has been very strong (and very popular) for the past couple patches the popularization of the [[Frostfire Gauntlet]] into [[Black Cleaver]] build has made her a force to be reckoned with in the current meta. That's why this change worries me slightly. [[Senna]] is still strong with guinsoo's, and this will only make her stronger. To me, this feels like a compensation buff for a nerf she has yet to receive. I expect [[Senna]] to get knocked down a peg in patch 11.11.[/indent]
