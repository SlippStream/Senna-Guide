[tr height=120][td][icon=flash size=70 border="4px solid #06e08c" border-radius=8px][/td][td padding=15][[Flash]] is the most self-explanatory summoner spell, you'll always take it. It supplements [[Senna]]'s immobility by giving her better engage and escape tools. It's cooldown is 5 minutes without [[Ionian Boots of Lucidity]], and 4 minutes 30 seconds with them.[/td][/tr]
[tr height=120][td][icon=heal size=70 border="4px solid #06e08c" border-radius=8px][/td][td padding=15]I prefer [[Heal]] over [[Ignite]] if you can get your ADC to take [[Ignite]] or [[Exhaust]]. [[Heal]] doesn't require you to move closer than your auto range to be effective, and it's the most useful for yourself and your carry. [[Heal]]'s cooldown is 4 minutes without [[Ionian Boots of Lucidity]], and 3 minutes 36 seconds with them.[/td][/tr]
[tr height=120][td][icon=ignite size=70 border="4px solid #06e08c" border-radius=8px][/td][td padding=15]By far the most popular option, [[Ignite]] is the standard for supports. However, I'm not a huge fan of it on [[Senna]] because of its 600 range; [[Senna]] starts with 600 range, and it doesn't take long for her to get to 620 and above, in which case [[Ignite]] requires you to step closer than your auto attack range, something that you want to avoid when positioning. But, into heal-heavy botlanes, it's a good companion to [[Executioner's Calling]]. [[Ignite]]'s cooldown is 3 minutes without [[Ionian Boots of Lucidity]], and 2 minutes 42 seconds with them.[/td][/tr]
[tr height=120][td][icon=barrier size=70 border="4px solid #06e08c" border-radius=8px][/td][td padding=15][[Barrier]] is the safest summoner spell to take on [[Senna]]. Being an immobile marksman makes her susceptible to dives and CC, and [[Barrier]] helps protect against that. However, you do lose the pressure that a combat summoner spell like [[Ignite]], [[Exhaust]], or [[Heal]] provides. I normally only take this into a poke heavy botlane like [[Caitlyn]] / [[Lux]]. [Barrier]]'s cooldown is 3 minutes without [[Ionian Boots of Lucidity]], and 2 minutes 42 seconds with them.[/td][/tr]
[tr height=120][td][icon=exhaust size=70 border="4px solid #06e08c" border-radius=8px][/td][td padding=15]If I want to take a combat summoner spell and my ADC refuses to take something besides heal, I opt for [[Exhaust]] instead of [[Ignite]]. [[Exhaust]]'s 650 range negates the early-game problem with [[Ignite]], giving you more room to position at the edge of your attack range, and giving you an upper hand in a skirmish if you [[Exhaust]] their ADC. [[Exhaust]]'s cooldown is 3 minutes 30 seconds without [[Ionian Boots of Lucidity]], and 3 minutes 9 seconds with them.[/td][/tr]
